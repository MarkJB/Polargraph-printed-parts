These printed parts are still a work in progress.

The feet and pulleys work well.

The feet use 28mm? dia broom handle from homebase and the slot is made for 12~13mm thick board (also from homebase).

The pulleys use ball chain, also from home base.

The Gondola needs work and the current scad files are a bit of a mess. The threads don't work correctly and parts needed to be turned down to a push fit.
