These printed parts are still a work in progress.

The Gondola updated to be a push fit for the pen holder. The idea is you can print a bunch of pen holders and load up your pens to enable quick colour changes. Current version is untested so I can't verify the fit is good.

The feet and pulleys work well.

The feet use 28mm? dia broom handle from homebase and the slot is made for 12~13mm thick board (also from homebase).

The pulleys use ball chain, also from home base.
